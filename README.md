# My website!!!

## Welcome
It seems you've stumbled across the repository for my website - zachjbrowning.tech!! It is a pretty basic site built with the following:
 - ⚛️ React for the frontend
 - 🎒 Webpack to bundle up all the modules
 - 🔏 Babel to compile all the javascript
 - ⏩ Express for a minimal backend


Other than that, maybe visit the site for real - https://zachjbrowning.tech - and enjoy!
